# Renewable Power Generation and Loss Prediction for Indian Residential Houses Using LSTM and RNN


This project presents a robust and efficient framework for forecasting renewable power generation and predicting energy losses in Indian residential houses by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques.

The system integrates historical energy data and environmental parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. Key components include:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques such as normalization, handling missing values, and temporal feature extraction ensure data quality and model reliability.
2. **LSTM-Based Architecture:**, A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to capture long-term temporal dependencies in sequential energy data, improving generation prediction accuracy.
3. **RNN Model:**, A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model complements the LSTM by learning short-term patterns and anomalies in energy consumption and generation trends.
4. **Hybrid Framework:**, The system fuses outputs from LSTM and RNN to provide a comprehensive prediction of renewable energy generation and associated losses.

The proposed model is validated using real-world datasets and achieves high accuracy in renewable power forecasting and energy loss prediction, making it a valuable tool for sustainable energy management in Indian households.
